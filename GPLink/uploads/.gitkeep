# Uploads folder
This folder stores ECG and X-Ray images uploaded by clinic doctors.

Images are saved with format: `{consultation_id}_{filename}`

Note: On cloud platforms with ephemeral storage (like Render free tier), 
uploaded files will be deleted on redeploy. For production, consider using:
- AWS S3
- Cloudinary
- Azure Blob Storage
